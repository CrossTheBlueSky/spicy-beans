~~~~~~~~Problem~~~~~~~~~

Given two non-negative integers "low" and "high", return the count of
ODD NUMBERS between "low" and "high" (inclusive).

~~~~~~~Logic~~~~~~~~~~~

Populate an array with each integer between low and high
For loop that checks each value for being divisible by 2
Return all values that are NOT divisible by 2.
 */

 var countOdds = function(low, high) {
    
    oddIntegers = 0;
    
    while(low <= high){
        
        if(low % 2 != 0)
        {
        oddIntegers++
        }
        
        low++
        

    }
    
    return oddIntegers
 
}


/*~~~~~~~~~Better Solution~~~~~~~~~~~
var countOdds = function(low, high) {
   
//    Set the low end to the nearest odd number within the set

    if (low % 2 === 0) {
        low++  
    } 

 //   Set the high end to the nearest odd number within the set
    if (high % 2 === 0) {
        high-- 
    } 
    
 //   subtract high from low, which will always give an even result (since we're subtracting odd from odd)
 //   Then divide by 2, since our high-low will always be even.
 //   This value will always be one less than our answer, so we increment by 1 to return the solution.

    return (high - low) / 2 + 1
};
