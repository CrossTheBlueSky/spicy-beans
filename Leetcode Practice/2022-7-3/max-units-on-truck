~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~SETUP~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Have to put some amount of boxes onto ONE TRUCK
     You are given a 2D array boxTypes, where boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxes, numberOfUnitsPerBox].
        numberOfBoxes^i is the number of boxes of type i.
        numberOfUnitsPerBox^i is the number of units in each box of type i.

     You are also given an integer, truckSize, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck.
     You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed truckSize

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~GOAL~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Return the MAXIMUM total number of UNITS that can be put on the truck.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~LOGIC~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Sort the array to find which boxes have the most units in them
2. Loop through the array. On each pass
    Check if numberOfBoxes = 0
        If not, reduce it by 1
        Also, increase the totalUnits by whatever the numberOfUnitsPerBox value is
3. return the value gained from 2

var maximumUnits = function(boxTypes, truckSize) {
  
    
    let totalUnits = 0;
    let currentStack = 0;
    
    boxTypes.sort((a, b) => b[1]-a[1])

    for(i = 0; i < truckSize; i++)
    {
        if (boxTypes[currentStack][0] !== 0)
        {

            totalUnits = totalUnits + boxTypes[currentStack][1]

            boxTypes[currentStack][0] = boxTypes[currentStack][0] -1
 
            

        }

           else if(currentStack+1 < boxTypes.length)
        {
            currentStack++    
            totalUnits = totalUnits + boxTypes[currentStack][1]
            boxTypes[currentStack][0] = boxTypes[currentStack][0] -1
        }
        

    }
    
    return totalUnits;
