~~~~~~~~SETUP~~~~~~~~

You are playing a game that has n levels numbered from 0 to n-1. You are given a 0-indexed
integer array "damage" where damage[i] is the amount of health you will lose to complete the
ith level.

You are also given an integer "armor." You may use your armor ability at most once during the
game on any level which will protect you from at most "armor" damage.

You must complete the levels in order and your health must be greater than 0 at all times
to beat the game.

Return the minimum health you need to start with to beat the game.

~~~~~LOGIC~~~~~~~~

1. Determine the total damage that will be taken
2. Compare the armor value to the damage per level
    2a. If there is a level with value equal to or greater than armor, subtract armor from
        total damage taken.
3. Return the total damage taken+1 as the solution.

var minimumHealth = function(damage, armor) {
  
    totalDamage = damage.reduce((previousValue, currentValue) => previousValue + currentValue, 
    0);
    damage = damage.sort((a, b) => b - a )

    if(damage.includes(armor) || damage[0] > armor)
    {

        totalDamage = totalDamage - armor

    }

    else 
    {
        totalDamage = totalDamage - damage[0]
    }

    return totalDamage+1
};
