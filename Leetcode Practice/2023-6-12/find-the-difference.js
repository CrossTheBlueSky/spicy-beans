/* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Question~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Logical Breakdown~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. I just split them both and then filter string t, right? RIGHT?!
2. It can be slightly faster to do it iteratively, actually. The first time that an index in s doesn't match its partner in t, return it. s
3. Nevermind, it shuffles the string first. Silly me.
4. I'll probably have to do a loop that removes a value from t if it's found in s until there's only one thing left in t
5. Or just stop being a silly goose and sort them both first and go back to the iterative approach

var findTheDifference = function(s, t) {
    
    let arr1 = s.split("")
    arr1.sort()
    let arr2 = t.split("")
    arr2.sort()
    let i = 0
    
    while(arr1[i] === arr2[i]){
        i++
    }

        return arr2[i]
