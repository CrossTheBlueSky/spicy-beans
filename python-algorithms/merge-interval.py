# Merge Intervals
# Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], 
# merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping 
# intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

def merge(intervals):
    # Sort intervals based on start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If merged is empty or if current interval does not overlap with previous,
        # simply append it.
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous intervals.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    
    return merged

# Test the function
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
print(merge(intervals))  # Should print [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

# Explanation:
# 1. We first sort the intervals based on their start time. This ensures that 
#    overlapping intervals are adjacent.
# 2. We iterate through the sorted intervals:
#    - If the merged list is empty or if the current interval doesn't overlap 
#      with the previous interval in merged, we append the current interval.
#    - If there is an overlap, we merge the current interval with the previous 
#      one by updating the end time of the previous interval.
# 3. The result is a list of merged intervals with no overlaps.

# Time complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of intervals.
# Space complexity: O(n) to store the merged intervals.

# These solutions demonstrate efficient use of data structures (OrderedDict for LRU Cache)
# and algorithmic thinking (sorting and linear traversal for Merge Intervals).
